About
=====

This project provides a Flash plug-in for measuring analytics within Brightcove video players. It can be used out-of-the-box for simple analytics or as a framework to customize data.

Universal Update
================

###Universal analyics support
This plugin now additionally supports Universal Analytics. To use Universal Analytics, add `&universal=true` to the plugin URL.

###Non-interaction events
If using Universal Analytics you can also opt to use non-interaction events by adding `&ni=true` to the URL. Non-interaction events probably make sense for video playback.

###Other changes

* Fixes crash if no content has been loaded into the player yet at the time the plugin initialises
* Uses "Brightcove Player" rather than "null" if `&playerType` isn't specified, as originally documented
* Bumped version number to 2 for Universal Analytics changes

Setup
=====

If you don't want to modify the code, follow these steps:

1.  Grab the latest `GoogleAnalytics.swf` file from the `bin-release` folder. (Go  [here](https://github.com/mister-ben/Google-Analytics-SWF/blob/master/bin-release/GoogleAnalytics.swf), click `view raw`).

2.  Upload the file to a server that's URL addressable; make note of that URL. Make sure a [crossdomain secuirty policy file](http://support.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/docs/cross-domain-security-flash) is present on that server.

3.  Add `?accountNumber=UA-123456789-0` to the URL (UA-123456789-0 will be
  replaced with your Google Analytics Account Number)

  * By default, all of these events will be tracked under the Google
    Analytics Category of "Brightcove Player". If you'd like to change that,
    you can specify `playerType` as another parameter,
    e.g. `?accountNumber=UA-123456789-0&playerType=Open%20Source%20Testing`
    
    Also, you can specify the playerType as {playername} to have it dynamically 
    use the name you specified for the player in the Brightcove Studio. 
    e.g. `?accountNumber=UA-123456789-0&playerType={playername}`

    * Note that the `playerType` must be URL-encoded
  
  * If you need to use Universal Analytics, append `&universal=true` to the URL

  * If you use Universal Analytics and want to use non-interaction events, add `&ni=true` to the URL

  * Alternatively, these parameters can be added to the publishing code as
    below (`playerType` is optional):

    `<param name="accountNumber" value="UA-123456789-0" /><param name="playerType" value="Open%20Source%20Testing" />`

4.  Log in to your Brightcove account

5.  Edit your Brightcove player and add the URL under the "plugins" tab

6.  Save your player changes
  
If you want to make modifications to the SWF / codebase, follow these steps:

1.  Import the project into either FlexBuilder or FlashBuilder

2.  Add the `.swc` files in the `lib` folder under the project's properties
  setting 

3.  To get a SWF of an optimized size, make sure to do a release build

Usage
=====

*Some of these details are out of date due to Google Analytics changes*

To understand how Google Analytics treats Categories, Actions and Labels,
please refer to the Google Analytics
[Event Tracking Guide](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/eventTrackerGuide.html).

Google Analytics doesn't track data in real time, but after approximately
one to two hours you should see events appearing in your account. Make sure
you're viewing the current day - by default Google Analytics will show a
different timeframe that doesn't include the current day. In the left-hand
navigation, you'll see a "Content" section, and underneath is "Event
Tracking". Click that to see the overview, categories, actions and labels
from your player(s).

When the media complete event fires, the plug-in is also sending along the
amount of time that a user watched that video. If a user skips around in a
video, you can expect to see a time that's less than the video's duration.
If a user watches a section more than once it is possible that the time
watched for that video will be longer than the video's duration. This shows
up in the "Event Value" column for the event, and appears as the length of
time in seconds. 

The video's "name" is sent through as a customized string. You'll see it
appear as `[Video ID] | [Video Name]`. Including the video ID will allow
you to programmatically use this data at a later time, as well as provide
you an easy method to look up the video up in your Brightcove account.
